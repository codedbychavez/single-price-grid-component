## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt more about flexbox, this is something I am aiming to improve by working on these challenges.

The easiest way to center an element is to make its parent a flex container, and add the following css properties to it:

```html
<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="flex-child"> </div>
</div>
```
```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to tackle more challenges that can be solved using flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts) - I found this really helpful and I recommend anyone who is looking to learn and understand flexbox.
